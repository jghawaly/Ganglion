# Ganglion
The Ganglion SNN simulation library was designed to allow for a flexible, object-oriented, and easy way to simulate spiking neural networks strictly using neuroscience-inspired methods.

If one wishes to use the deskewed MNSIT dataset, the .npy files can be downloaded here and place in the  /ganglion/datasets/deskewed_mnist directory: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11p6vPdvzxcd8yGdec0KzQIJeuUUxRO9y?usp=sharing

The documentation is currently a work in progress and will be updated as soon as it is ready for release.
